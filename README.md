Final project for my Contemporary Programming class in C#

READ FIRST: This project relies on a Microsoft SQL Server database instance in order to function correctly.

Steps to build the database:

1. Use the script provided in this repository to build a database schema in SQL Server.
2. In Visual Studio, use the same credentials for your server instance when you add a new connection.
